h1. Frequently Asked Questions

h2. What is JsSIP?

JsSIP is a client side pure JavaScript library to build SIP endpoints in Web environments.



h2. What can I do with JsSIP?

You can build a complete SIP user agent in your Web page:

* Send and/or receive multimedia calls.
* Send and/or receive text messages.



h2. Can I use JsSIP from any web browser?

See the <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/misc/interoperability" %> section.



h2. What do I need to run a JsSIP environment?

JsSIP is a SIP WebSocket client. It needs a SIP WebSocket capable server to which connect and exchange SIP messages.



h2. Can I connect a JsSIP client directly to my existing SIP server?

Yes, if it supports SIP over WebSocket. See the <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/misc/interoperability" %> section.




h2. What if my existing SIP server lacks SIP WebSocket Server capabilities?

You can put an "OverSIP":http://oversip.net SIP WebSocket Proxy in front of your existing SIP server.

* Your SIP server/registrar must implement Path mechanism (<%= link_to "RFC 3327", "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3327" %>).
* If not (for example Asterisk which does not support Path), use OverSIP's "OutboundMangling":http://www.oversip.net/documentation/1.3.x/api/built_in_modules/outbound_mangling/ module.



h2. Asterisk rejects REGISTER from JsSIP

Asterisk does not like a SIP REGISTER whose Contact header contains an URI with "xxxxx.invalid" domain (see the related "issue":https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-19716). If you use Asterisk as registrar enable the UA configuration option <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/api/ua_configuration_parameters/#hack_ip_in_contact", :text=>"hack_ip_in_contact" %>.
