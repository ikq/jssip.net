h1. Events

Every event handler in JsSIP is fired with a single argument, being this a data @Object@ defined by the class emitting the event. See the corresponding event definition for further information about its data @Object@.

The event handlers are fired with the event emitter instance as @this@ value (this is, the same object or instance on which the listener was installed via the @on()@ method).


h2. Example

CODE_BEGIN "javascript"
var ua = new JsSIP.UA( ... );

ua.on('newRTCSession', function(data) {
  var originator = data.originator;
  var session = data.session;
  var request = data.request;

  // Stop the UA. Note that `this` is bound to the `ua` instance.
  this.stop();
});
